flacthis
========

To clone a FLAC lossless audio directory structure, turning it into an mp3-converted structure.

NOTE: No files or directories will ever be deleted. Only new directories and files can be created.
 This offers similar functionality to FlacSquisher, but written in Python and is easy to setup for cronjobs.

Prerequisites:

	- Lame

	- FLAC

	- Mutagen Python library (used for tagging)

	- Python2

HOW-TO USE:
	Currently source and destination directories must be hardcoded in the Python source file. Please ensure that the flac and lame paths 
are setup properly.

Run, and enjoy.
